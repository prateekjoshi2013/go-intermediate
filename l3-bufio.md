The bufio package in Go provides buffered I/O operations. It wraps an io.Reader or io.Writer and provides buffering for more efficient reading and writing of data. It's particularly useful for scenarios where you want to read or write data in chunks rather than one byte at a time.

The package includes the following types:

Reader (bufio.Reader):

bufio.Reader wraps an io.Reader and provides buffering for more efficient reading of data.
It provides methods like Read, ReadByte, ReadBytes, ReadLine, etc.
The Read method reads and returns data from the underlying io.Reader in chunks, making it more efficient.

```go
    package main

    import (
        "bufio"
        "fmt"
        "strings"
    )

    func main() {
        input := "Hello, bufio.Reader!"

        reader := bufio.NewReader(strings.NewReader(input))
        buffer := make([]byte, 10)

        for {
            n, err := reader.Read(buffer)
            if err != nil {
                break
            }
            fmt.Print(string(buffer[:n]))
        }
    }
```

Writer (bufio.Writer):

bufio.Writer wraps an io.Writer and provides buffering for more efficient writing of data.
It provides methods like Write, WriteByte, WriteString, Flush, etc.
The Write method writes data to the underlying io.Writer in chunks, making it more efficient.


```go
    package main

    import (
        "bufio"
        "fmt"
        "os"
    )

    func main() {
        file, err := os.Create("output.txt")
        if err != nil {
            fmt.Println("Error creating file:", err)
            return
        }
        defer file.Close()

        writer := bufio.NewWriter(file)
        data := "Hello, bufio.Writer!"

        _, err = writer.WriteString(data)
        if err != nil {
            fmt.Println("Error writing to file:", err)
            return
        }

        // Ensure that any buffered data is written to the underlying writer
        err = writer.Flush()
        if err != nil {
            fmt.Println("Error flushing buffer:", err)
            return
        }
    }

```

#### Reading from STDIN

- read from standard input (stdin) using the os and bufio packages. Here's a simple example demonstrating how to read input from stdin

```go
    package main

    import (
        "bufio"
        "fmt"
        "os"
    )

    func main() {
        // Create a new scanner that reads from standard input
        scanner := bufio.NewScanner(os.Stdin)

        fmt.Print("Enter some text: ")

        // Read input from stdin until Enter is pressed
        for scanner.Scan() {
            text := scanner.Text()

            // Exit the loop if an empty line is entered
            if text == "" {
                break
            }

            fmt.Println("You entered:", text)
        }

        // Check for any errors that may have occurred during scanning
        if err := scanner.Err(); err != nil {
            fmt.Println("Error reading input:", err)
        }
    }
```
